# hello-world
The first repository of many!
Before we undergo this learning journey first, I suppose we should start with a little bit about me. 
  I was born, raised, and reside in Mississippi
  I'm a lover of music, and consider myslef quite the amateur!
  I'm also an avid gamer, and can remember the dawn of online gaming, RIP Dreamcast, the brightest stars fade the quickest
  
  I think that'll do for now...Why try to cram everything into our initial meeting when we have a life time to learn each other?

Shhhh....don't make it weird.
