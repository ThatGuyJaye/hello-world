# hello-world
This is the first repository of many!

Before we undergo this learning journey , I suppose we should start with a little bit about me. 
 
 I was born, raised, and reside in Mississippi
 
 I'm a lover of music, and consider myslef quite the amateur!
 
 I'm also an avid gamer, and can remember the dawn of online gaming, RIP Dreamcast, the brightest stars fade the quickest
  
I think that'll do for now...Why try to cram everything into our initial meeting when we have a lifetime to learn each other?

Hey now...don't make it weird.
